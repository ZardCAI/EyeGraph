Normal optic disc margins with mild late-phase hyperfluorescence, subtle macular changes, stable peripheral perfusion, and no significant capillary dropout, indicating preserved retinal architecture.
Disc neovascular fronds with moderate peripheral capillary nonperfusion, focal macular swelling, consistent arterial filling timelines, and intact central venous flow without marked structural distortion.
Nearly elevated cup-to-disc ratio suggestive of early glaucoma, minimal macular edema, uniform arterio-venous filling, mid-peripheral ischemic spots, and no major degenerative changes.
Minimal fibrous reaction around the optic disc, partial peripheral retinal occlusion, scattered capillary dropout, intact central venous drainage, and mild macular microaneurysm formation.
Tortuous retinal venous dilation with faint vessel wall fluorescence staining, scattered micro lesions in the macula, mild capillary leakage, and well-defined optic disc perfusion.
Temporal choroidal thinning near the disc, pinpoint RPE anomalies around the fovea, discrete peripheral leakage, no pronounced mid-peripheral changes, and preserved macular contour.
Diffuse vitreous haze obscuring the inferior retina, neovascular proliferation, patchy macular fluid accumulation, normal disc perfusion, and moderate capillary dropout in the periphery.
Cystoid fluid pockets in the late phase, widened foveal avascular zone, scattered ischemic patches, well-demarcated disc boundaries, and maintained vascular transit times.
Slurred disc edge definition with delayed leakage, mild RPE mottling, scattered remnants of old lesions, subtle macular edema, and otherwise stable vascular filling patterns.
Consistent arterial-venous flow with localized peripheral occlusion, mild small-vessel permeability defects, preserved foveal architecture, and no evidence of disc neovascular growth.
