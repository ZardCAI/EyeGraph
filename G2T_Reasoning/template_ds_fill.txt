The optic disc fluorescein angiogram is essentially normal. In the venous phase of the macular region, punctate hyperfluorescence suggestive of RPE damage is observed. Late-phase leakage expands with pooling of dye while maintaining intact foveal architecture. Peripheral retinal vasculature appears unremarkable without evidence of vascular occlusion or neovascularization.
Fluorescein angiography reveals tortuous retinal veins with segmental wall staining and increased capillary permeability. The posterior pole demonstrates microaneurysms and focal areas of capillary closure. Late-phase imaging shows cystic macular edema secondary to dilated perifoveal capillaries. Mid-peripheral retina remains unaffected with normal vascular filling patterns.
Early phase imaging identifies scattered hyperfluorescent spots in the posterior pole progressing to late-phase leakage with dye accumulation. The foveal avascular zone shows architectural distortion accompanied by capillary dilation. Peripheral evaluation reveals patchy non-perfusion areas temporally with preserved nasal vascular integrity.
Venous phase analysis demonstrates delayed filling in the superotemporal quadrant with associated capillary dropout. Late frames exhibit diffuse staining of the optic disc margins and segmental venous wall hyperfluorescence. Macular evaluation confirms intact photoreceptor layer despite perifoveal capillary leakage.
Angiographic findings include widespread microvascular abnormalities with arterial narrowing and venous beading. The temporal periphery shows extensive laser scars alternating with residual non-perfusion zones. Late-phase pooling within the macular avascular zone correlates with clinical edema.
Imaging reveals mild venous dilation and arteriolar attenuation throughout the posterior pole. Focal areas of capillary hyperpermeability appear superior to the vascular arcades without late-phase staining. The nasal mid-periphery demonstrates chorioretinal atrophy with window defects.
Fluorescein transit shows normal arterial filling times with delayed venous return in the inferotemporal quadrant. Peripapillary capillaries exhibit focal dilation and late leakage. Macular architecture remains preserved despite scattered punctate RPE defects.
Vascular analysis identifies neovascular fronds along the superonasal arcade with intense late-phase leakage. Widespread capillary non-perfusion is evident in the temporal periphery. The foveal zone demonstrates mild edema secondary to perifoveal capillary incompetence.
Late-phase frames reveal petaloid hyperfluorescence in the macular region consistent with cystoid edema. The optic disc shows mild staining without structural disruption. Peripheral evaluation demonstrates laser scars with adjacent capillary dropout.
Angiographic findings include venous tortuosity with segmental wall staining and arteriovenous nicking. The posterior pole exhibits microaneurysms and focal capillary closure. Macular integrity remains preserved despite mild late-phase hyperfluorescence.
